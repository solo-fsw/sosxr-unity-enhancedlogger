## Introduction

This Unity package provides a flexible and customizable logging utility named `Log`. It allows you to log messages with
different log levels (Error, Warning, Debug, Info, Success, and Verbose) and customize the appearance of log messages with colors.
The utility is designed to be easy to integrate into your Unity projects.

## Features

- Log messages with various log levels
- Suppress ones you don't want to see.
- Runs logs only in Unity Editor and Development Build. It will suppress your logs in a Production build, making it a cheap solution
  for logging, and the best of both worlds: all the logging you could want in development, and none of the overhead in
  production.
- Click to go to the source of the log message, both the GameObject where the call came from, and the code + line number
  it is referring to.
- Customize log message appearance with colors (see the `EnhancedLoggerSettings` asset).

## Downsides

- When using the Static version (`Log.Static("lala");`) you can't click on the log message itself, but you can click on the second line of the log to go to the
  line number in the class (Otherwise you'll go to the `Log.cs` class instead).
- It can only find the GameObject that called the Log message if it is a MonoBehaviour. If you call the `Log` directly (as you would in a static class for instance), it will not be able to click to find the GameObject.
- You need to copy the Demo files into your normal Asset folder to use the Demo scene. See [this explanation here as to why](https://forum.unity.com/threads/it-is-not-allowed-to-open-a-scene-in-a-read-only-package-why.1148036/).

## Installation

### Unity Package Manager

1. Open your Unity project.
2. Open the Unity Package Manager from the `Window` menu.
3. Click the `+` button in the top-left corner of the Package Manager window.
4. Select `Add package from git URLâ€¦`.
5. Enter the following Git URL in the input field: `https://github.com/mrstruijk/EnhancedLogger.git` (making sure of the
   `.git` at the end).
6. Click the `Add` button.

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation (also allowing you more customizability), clone or download [the repository](https://github.com/mrstruijk/EnhancedLogger) to your Unity project.

## Dependencies

Does not have any direct dependencies, but does work well with the [In-Game Debug Console](https://github.com/solo-fsw/sosxr-unity-ingamedebugconsole), originally created by [yasirkula](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityIngameDebugConsole).

# Usage

## Log Levels

- Error
- Warning
- Debug
- Info
- Success
- Verbose

Each LogLevel shows the logs of the selected LogLevel and all logs with a higher LogLevel. For example, if you select
`Warning`, you will see both `Warning`, and `Error` logs. Selecting `Verbose` will show all logs. The default LogLevel
is `Info` (also showing `Debug`, `Warning`, and `Error` logs).

### Opinionated Usage

`Debug` is used only for when you're working on a specific module. Put in as many logs as you want, to see how the thing
you're building is progressing. Then, when things 'settle down' and it starts working as intended: either move the
 `Debug` logs to the appropriate higher or lower level, or delete them. By the end of each day / sprint / module, `Debug` should be
empty again.

#### `Info` and `Success`

With `Verbose` there's too many other messages that are displaying, while a `Warning` is often also not what I was looking for. A lot of the messages were of things that were simply happening, without them needing to warn me of things. That's what the `Info` level is made for. Similarly, but only for the good stuff: `Success`.

## Settings

Settings can be found in a ScriptableObject found in the Resources folder called `EnhancedLoggerSettings`.

### LogLevel

In the Scene view, select the LogLevel you want to use. This will determine which log messages are displayed in the
Console. It shows the logs of the selected LogLevel and all logs with a higher LogLevel.

Alternatively you can set the LogLevel in the Menu bar at SOSXR > EnhancedLogger, or via the aforementioned Settings object.

### Colors

You can set the color for each log level in the `EnhancedLoggerSettings` object.

### Prefix

Prefixes, such as `[DEBUG]` can be set in the `EnhancedLoggerSettings` object. Alternatively: leave blank.

## Log Messages

To add logs to your scripts, see the example below, and the Samples folder for more examples.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using SOSXR.EnhancedLogger;

// Log messages with different levels. Note that depending on the CurrentLogLevel, maybe not all messages will be logged.
public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject OtherGameObject;
    
    private void Start()
    {
        // You can use them as an extension method:
        // Standard way of logging is using 'this'. It will log the message from the current gameobject and print it's name.
        this.Debug("This is a debug message.");
        this.Warning("This is a warning message.");
     
        // Another object could serve as well.   
        OtherGameObject.Success("This is a success message. It is called from another gameobject"); // It will display the name of that other GameObject
        
        // Or from the static class:
        // These are useful when the object you're calling the Log from can be destroyed. Be careful with the second one, thay may cause a NullReferenceException anyway.
        Log.Static("This is an info message.", LogLevel.Info);
        Log.Static("This is a debug  message.");
    }
}
```

It also works on static classes, or classes that are not derived from `MonoBehaviour`. Just use the `Log` class
directly (e.g. `Log.Static("This is a debug message.");`).

## Tests

You can find tests in the `LogTests.cs` file. To run the tests, open the Unity Test Runner and execute the tests from
there.
